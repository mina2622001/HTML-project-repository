<p style="font-size:20px;" >Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition,Learning, Planning, Problem solving. In this topic we shall discus the following subjects;Deep learning, Machine learning, Computer Programming, Medical field.Deep Learning has enabled many practical applications of Machine Learning and by extension the overall field of AI. Deep Learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assists seem possible, even likely. Driverless cars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon. AI i s the present and the future. With Deep Learning’s help, AI may even get to that science fiction state we’ve so long imagined.Machine Learning at its most basic isthe practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world. So rather than hand-coding software routines with a specific set of instructions to accomplish a particular task, the machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and algorithmsthat give it the ability to learn how to perform the task.</p>
