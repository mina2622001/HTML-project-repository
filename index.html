<p style="font-size:25px;"> Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning and neural networks represent incredibly exciting and powerful machine learning-based techniques used to solve many real-world problems.While human-like deductive reasoning, inference, and decision-making by a computer is still a long time away, there have been remarkable gains in the application of AI techniques and associated algorithms. This research attempts to present an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A generally accepted theory that “machine will do and think like humans more in the future” is the concept behind AI. Brief literature of different aspects by which AI is achieved like expert system, knowledge based systems (knowledge engineering), neural networks, fuzzy logic, neuro fuzzy logic and fuzzy expert system,is included in order to have a clear understanding of AI. Along with the different applications of AI, application of expert system to solve the design problem of mechanical spring is also included in this paper.It is concluded that extensive ongoing research in the field of AI gives an idea that in near future a day will come when human beings and machines will merge into cyborgs or cybernetic organisms that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea is called transhumanism. </p>
